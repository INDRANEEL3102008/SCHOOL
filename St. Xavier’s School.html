                 <h4>For all Xavierians, food was never scarce during their college days. Not just because this iconic college is on the hip and happening Park Street of Kolkata, surrounded by equally historic food joints, some of which are running from the British era, but because the college has a very well-stocked canteen. For those who feel going to joints next door like Flurys, might burn a hole in their pockets, they can always pay a visit to the St Xavier’s Canteen, housed within the building itself and open almost throughout the day, from 8am in the morning.</h4>
